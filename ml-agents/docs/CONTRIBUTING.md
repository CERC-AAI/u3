## 3. Choose an issue or feature
Browse the project's issue tracker or discussions to find an open issue or feature that you would like to contribute to. Read the guidelines and comments associated with the issue to understand the requirements and constraints.

## 4. Make your changes
Create a new branch for your changes based on the main branch of the ML-Agents repository. Implement your code changes or add new features as necessary. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding style and conventions.

* Example: Let's say you want to add support for a new type of reward function in the ML-Agents framework. You can create a new branch named feature/reward-function to implement this feature.

## 5. Test your changes
Run the appropriate tests to ensure your changes work as intended. If necessary, add new tests to cover your code and verify that it doesn't introduce regressions.

* Example: For the reward function feature, you would write tests to check different scenarios and expected outcomes of the new reward function.

## 6. Submit a pull request
Push your branch to your forked repository and submit a pull request (PR) to the ML-Agents main repository. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes, explaining the problem you solved or the feature you added.

* Example: In the pull request description, you would explain how the new reward function works, its benefits, and any relevant implementation details.

## 7. Respond to feedback
Be responsive to any feedback or comments provided by the project maintainers. Address the feedback by making necessary revisions to your code and continue the discussion if required.

## 8. Continuous integration and code review
The ML-Agents project utilizes automated continuous integration (CI) systems to run tests on pull requests. Address any issues flagged by the CI system and actively participate in the code review process by addressing comments from reviewers.

## 9. Merge your changes
Once your pull request has been approved and meets all the project's requirements, a project maintainer will merge your changes into the main repository. Congratulations, your contribution has been successfully integrated!
